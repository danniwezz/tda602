How to replicate:
1. Use setBalance instead of safewidrawal on line 28. 
2. Set breakpoint line 22 at if(cost > wallet.getBalance()).
3. Start two exections
4. Write car and pen in the two different executions
5. Step to getBalance() in wallet.setBalance(wallet.getBalance() - cost) for the pen execution
6. Finish the execution with car input
7. Finish the execution with pen input
8. You should now have 29960 in your wallet but a car and a pen in your pocket
