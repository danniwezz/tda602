Part 0: your ShoppingCart.java with clear instructions for compile it and run it.
Compile the javafiles and the classfiles, we used intelliJ.

Part 1:
What is the shared resource? Who is sharing it?
The text files:
Pocket and wallet

What is the root of the problem?
Every user accesses the same wallet and the same pocket, and there is no mutual exclusion implemented
in this program. There is some critical sections in the shoppingcart.java that needs some kind of 
protection to ensure mutual exclusion.

Explain in detail how you can attack this system.
If two instances (A) and (B), are trying to make a purchase, and A is trying to buy a car, B is trying
to buy a pen. A and B is executing the program until they both get to set.balance(). Where both A and B run the function wallet.getBalance(), which returns 30 000 for both A and B. A then continue the execution, adjusting the balance to 0, and adding the car to the pocket. B then continue its execution, setting the balance to 29960, and adding the pen to the pocket. We have now bought a car and a pen for the super low price of 40dollar. And this is a problem.

Provide the program output and result, explaining the interleaving to achieve them.

Part 2: the code that secures buggy API
This is the code snippet that prevent the problems mentioned above. For more information about
declarations and initalizations, see wallet.java, shoppingcart.java.

 public void safeWithdraw(int valueToWithdraw) throws Exception {

            lock = this.channel.lock();
            this.file.seek(0);
            int balance = Integer.parseInt(this.file.readLine());
            this.file.setLength(0);
            if(balance - valueToWithdraw < 0){
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("To low balance");
            }

            String str = new Integer(balance - valueToWithdraw).toString()+'\n';
            this.file.writeBytes(str);
            if(lock != null){
                lock.release();
            }
    }
